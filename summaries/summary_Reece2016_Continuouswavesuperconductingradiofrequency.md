The transcript also discusses the cooling of the cavities, the use of an acid bath for cavity cleaning, and the tuning of the cavities for optimum power matching to the beam.<br>* This meeting transcript discusses the construction and testing of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF), a tool for nuclear physics research. The facility includes 160 cavities, each controlled by a precision power supply, and over 2030 magnets to direct and focus the electron beam. The production fabrication of the cavities was accomplished by a vendor, while the niobium components were fabricated predominantly using CEBAF in-house facilities. The cryomodules were carefully characterized and found to consistently beat the budgeted 15 W static heat leak. The cryomodule performance exceeded the CEBAF design requirements, despite a few nonfunctioning cavities. The central performance-limiting phenomenon for the installed SRF cavities in CEBAF was electron emission internal to the cavities.<br>* The meeting transcript discusses the performance of the installed SRF cavities in CEBAF and the challenges faced during commissioning. The cryomodules exhibited uncharacteristically low Q's, sustained cryogenic heat load, and periodic arcing phenomenon. Strategies were developed to maximize the useful accelerating voltage of CEBAF, including reducing the operating gradient of offending cavities and derating them. The analysis and operational adaptation to the periodic arcing phenomenon are explained in detail. The meeting transcript also discusses the constraints on rapid reset and the consequences of each arc trip.<br>* The transcript discusses the physical effects of arcs in waveguides, the analysis of vacuum recovery, and the initial operation capacity of the CEBAF accelerator, including the use of in situ cryomodule improvements and pushing the performance envelope. The use of helium processing on cavities is discussed as a technique to reduce field emission and arcing. The transcript also mentions the ability to deliver high current beams with stability and efficiency, and the optimization of individual cavity systems.<br>* This meeting transcript discusses the performance of CEBAF, a particle accelerator, over several years. The test demonstrated improved economy cavities and optimization algorithms, resulting in a decrease in the number of arc trips per day. The machine underwent maintenance and recovery after Hurricane Isabel in 2003. CEBAF was able to deliver high-quality beams to multiple experimental halls simultaneously. The use of high-pressure rinsing with ultra-pure water became a standard part of the JLab SRF cavity preparation protocol after 2003. The transcript also discusses improvements to safety and process control, including the introduction of a PLC-controlled closed chemistry cabinet.<br>* The meeting transcript discusses the improvements made to the SRF infrastructure at Jefferson Lab, including the addition of a PLC-controlled closed chemistry cabinet, electropolishing of niobium cavities, and the renovation of the cryomodule test facility. The Pansophy system was also developed to enhance workflow and data management. The C50 project aimed to refurbish cryomodules to establish a solid 6 GeV physics capability for a later upgrade to 12 GeV. The goal was to populate ten empty zones with 108 MV cryomodules, requiring new 13 kW klystrons. Overall, the improvements were made to reduce the impact of field emission on operational SRF accelerators.<br>* The meeting transcript discusses the upgrade of CEBAF, a particle accelerator. The existing klystrons were exploited and a new cryomodule design was created to maximize active length. The project faced challenges with unexpected loss contributions and unresolved problems but concluded with CEBAF ready to support robust physics running at 6 GeV. The development path for the C100 cryomodule was also discussed, including the creation of two C70 prototype cryomodules and a Renascence cryomodule. The Renascence cryomodule included a mixture of two different cell shapes and several unique solutions were developed for space constraints and sealing. Overall, the upgrades aimed to improve acceleration capabilities with dynamic heat load less than 250 W.<br>* The meeting transcript discusses the development and fabrication of cryomodules for use in beam line flanges. Unique solutions were developed, such as the "Radial-Wedge" clamp and "serpentine gasket" for UHV cryogenic seals. The Renascence cryomodule used a new "nutcracker-style" tuner, but issues arose, leading to the use of a scissor-jack style tuner. The LL cavities performed well during qualification tests, but mechanical binding of tuners was a problem. The C100 cavity design optimization and fabrication were completed, and BBU was encountered in CEBAF with Renascence. The investigation provided a rare experimental test of the multipass BBU beam dynamics theory. The formal start of the CEBAF 12 GeV upgrade project occurred in early 2009, and a contract for fabrication of 86 C100 cavities was awarded to Research Instruments.<br>* This meeting discusses the 12 GeV upgrade project, which required cells to attain the target fundamental mode in 2009. A contract for fabrication of 86 frequency resulted in an abnormal field configuration for C100 cavities for the project. The eight C100 cavities that make up a string for the CEBAF upgrade cryomodules are bolted directly together without intervening bellows. The first cryomodules met all of the performance cavity requirements, but the observed sensitivity to microphonics was more than anticipated. The direct mechanical coupling of the C100 cavities causes the Lorentz force tuning of a cavity to affect its neighbors.<br>* The meeting transcript discusses the performance of C100 cryomodules used in the CEBAF upgrade project. The direct mechanical coupling of the cavities causes the Lorentz force tuning of a cavity to affect its neighbors, which is managed by switching neighboring cavities to SEL mode in the event of a fault. The rf system used for the CEBAF upgrade cryomodules is of a completely new design and incorporates a digital self-excited loop (SEL) to dynamically manage the rf frequency during turn-on and trip recovery. Heat management is also discussed, with the diameter of the helium riser pipe and resistive heater operated within each helium vessel to provide a compensating cryogenic load when the rf is off. The delivered beam parameters for 6 GeV CEBAF and expected beam parameters for 12 GeV CEBAF are also listed. Finally, the transcript discusses the experimental evaluation of the C100 dipole HOM damping and BBU thresholds and the competitive award won by Jefferson Lab from the DOE Science Laboratory Infrastructure program to build the Technology and Engineering Development Facility Project (TEDF).<br>* The meeting discussed the progress of the CEBAF 12 GeV upgrade project, including the calculation of the beam momentum and phase offset of the cavity. The new calibration factors were downloaded in December 2015, and the delivery of 70 μA at 11 GeV to hall A dump was achieved in FY16. The meeting also addressed the limitations of the C100 cryomodule, which suffered from field emission loading and contamination. Efforts were initiated to identify the source of the contamination and potential remediation methods. The physics program has restarted, and explorations are underway to maximize the productivity of the 12 GeV era physics. The meeting also discussed recent physics highlights, including understanding the internal charge and magnetic structure of the proton and the description of complex nuclei at a fundamental level.<br>* The meeting transcript discusses the capabilities of the cold Spectrometer (CLAS) and the potential for discovering new heretofore unobserved hadron states predicted by quantum chromodynamics.
