<br><br>* This meeting transcript discusses the development and implementation of a continuous wave superconducting radio frequency electron linac for nuclear physics research at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The linac has evolved over the years and currently operates at 12 GeV. The use of superconducting rf technology has been essential for the linac's success, allowing for high precision energy definition and low energy spread. The linac was designed to support coincidence experiments with meaningful event rates and very narrowly discriminated kinematics. The history of the founding of CEBAF, the complex accelerator design, and the challenges faced during the design process are also discussed.<br><br>* The meeting transcript discusses the development and testing of SRF cavities for use in the CEBAF facility at Cornell University. The cavities were designed to operate at a frequency of 1499.2845 MHz and were composed of niobium structures. The design of the cavities underwent multiple iterations, with the final design incorporating hermetically assembled pairs of cavities and a hermetic alumina ceramic window. The transcript also discusses the challenges associated with building the cavities and the need for qualified commercial vendors.<br><br>* The meeting transcript discusses the challenges of establishing a superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) facility for particle accelerators, specifically for the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF). The transcript covers the development of niobium superconducting rf cavities, infrastructure investments, and the establishment of a full-spectrum SRF development and production facility. It also discusses the procurement contract for 360 five-cell niobium SRF cavities for CEBAF and the fabrication process, including the use of acid baths and chemical polishing. Overall, the transcript provides a detailed account of the technical and logistical challenges involved in establishing an SRF facility for particle accelerators.<br><br>* The transcript discusses the production and testing of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF). The facility consists of 160 cavities, with each cavity undergoing chemistry treatment and final frequency tuning. The beam is accelerated by 1-5 passes through the linacs and is directed by over 2030 magnets. The cryomodules were assembled with precision to align with the beam line, and commissioning tests were performed to ensure the cryomodule performance exceeded the CEBAF design requirements. The transcript also mentions the interest in fully exploiting the capabilities of the SRF cavities and setting up mechanisms for continuous improvement. The main performance-limiting issue was electron emission internal to the cavities.<br><br>* The meeting transcript discusses the performance of the CEBAF SRF cavities, including issues with low Q's, excessive heat load, and window arcs. The cryomodules were commissioned with a maximum operating gradient and a distribution of maximum usable gradients was determined. The CEBAF ceramic rf window was found to be mounted too close to the cavity waveguide, resulting in excessive rf losses. The arcing phenomenon was characterized and strategies were developed to maximize the useful accelerating voltage of CEBAF. Jay Benesch developed gradient-dependent models for the periodicity of arc events. The data accumulation was difficult and required extended periods of stable operation. The integrated system arc trip rate was analyzed to minimize operational downtime.<br><br>* The transcript discusses the physical effects of each arc, including the liberation of adsorbed gas from the adjoining waveguide and consequential faults in the waveguide vacuum interlock. The analysis of the vacuum recovery and integrated system arc P trip rate is also discussed. The CEBAF energy is maximized by building from hermetic cavity pairs with cold ceramic windows only 7.9 cm off the beam line. The commissioning of the full capability of CEBAF continued in 1995 and 1996, with highlights including delivering 25 μA cw beam at five discrete energies in an eight hour period and delivering 4.0 GeV, 80 μA cw beam to an experimental hall. The process of applying helium processing to the cavities in CEBAF is discussed, and it is noted that this process and requalification of cavities increased the installed CEBAF voltage by 155 MV. The transcript also discusses the ability to place 200 μA on the injector Faraday cup, retract that cup, and immediately transport lossless, full-power beam to the hall C dump and maintain this current for at least tens of minutes with all orbit locks off.<br><br>* This meeting transcript discusses the performance of the CEBAF particle accelerator in the early 2000s. The accelerator demonstrated improved economy cavities and optimization algorithms, and was able to reduce the number of arc trips per day. The accelerator also underwent maintenance after Hurricane Isabel, during which several cryomodules became inoperable due to helium-to-vacuum leaks. However, the accelerator was able to recover and support an active physics program, delivering "world's-best-quality" beams to three experimental halls simultaneously. The use of superconducting radiofrequency technology allowed for a high level of sophistication in the accelerator's performance.<br><br>* The meeting discussed the improvements made to SRF infrastructure at Jefferson Lab to increase the achievable accelerating gradient and reduce the impact of field emission on operational SRF accelerators. These improvements included the addition of a PLC-controlled closed chemistry cabinet in the cleanroom to replace the dipping of cavities in an open vat, upgrades to the final cleaning processes for niobium cavities, and the renovation of the cryomodule test facility. The meeting also discussed the refurbishment of ten 12.5 MV/m cryomodules to establish a solid 6 GeV physics capability and serve as the base for a later upgrade to 12 GeV. The project ran from 2006 to 2009 and involved disassembling each cryomodule and refreshing its cavities with improved processing techniques. The meeting also touched on plans for a 12 GeV CEBAF obtained by filling the five empty cryomodule slots in each linac and adding a tenth arc and a sixth pass through the north linac.<br><br>* The meeting transcript discusses the upgrades made to CEBAF, including the use of existing klystrons and the development of new cryomodules with increased active length and a new cavity design. The project faced challenges such as unexpected loss contributions and the need for a more agile low-level RF control system. The development of a new cryomodule design, Renascence, was launched to demonstrate 108 MV acceleration capability with a dynamic heat load of less than 250 W at 2.07 K. The cryomodule included a mixture of two different cell designs and unique solutions such as a custom high thermal conductivity feedthrough and a "Radial-Wedge" clamp. Performance realized after installation in CEBAF was lower than expected due to the use of the old LLRF system.<br><br>* The Renascence cryomodule used unique solutions like the "Radial-Wedge" clamp and "serpentine gasket" to provide high sealing forces and easy assembly. However, issues arose during assembly and testing, including mechanical binding of tuners and leaks in cryogenic instrumentation feedthroughs. The HOM couplers were moved closer to the end cells to compensate for weaker cell-to-cell coupling, and unnecessary coupling probes were removed. The C100 cavity design optimization and fabrication took place in 2006, and BBU instability was encountered in CEBAF with Renascence in 2007. The accelerator beam physicists were able to test their BBU model with different beam orbits and supplemental damping added to the cavity. The investigation and characterization process provided a motivation for the project, and subsequent investigation revealed that a double weld had been made on a cell equator during fabrication.<br><br>* This meeting transcript discusses the 12 GeV upgrade project for the CEBAF accelerator. The project required 86 frequency cells, which were fabricated by Research Instruments in Germany and delivered between July 2010 and March 2011. The cavities were tuned to a warm target frequency and fabricated from high-quality niobium sheets. The cryomodule design was refined for the upgrade, including changes to the cavity assembly and HOM couplers. The first cryomodule was tested in June 2011 and met all performance requirements, but sensitivity to microphonics was greater than anticipated. A solution was found by increasing the stiffness of the cavity tuner. All C100 cryomodules were installed in CEBAF by September 2013 and had integrated voltage performance ranging from 105 to 124 MV.<br><br>* The meeting discussed the performance of C100 cryomodules for the CEBAF upgrade, which uses a new design of rf system. The cryomodules were found to have integrated voltage performance ranging from 105 to 124 MV, but there were concerns about the direct mechanical coupling of the cavities causing detuning. To manage this, neighboring cavities are switched to SEL mode in the event of a fault until the trip is recovered. The cryomodules were also found to have good heat management, but there were issues with the distribution of heat within the helium vessels. The meeting also discussed HOM damping checks and the recalibration of momentum gains using a novel phase shift method. Jefferson Lab won a competitive award from the DOE to build the Technology and Engineering Development Facility Project.<br><br>* The meeting transcript discusses the progress of the CEBAF 12 GeV upgrade project, including the calculation of beam momentum and the delivery of 70 μA at 11 GeV to hall A dump. The new SRF technical work facility was completed in 2012, and efforts are underway to address issues with the C100 cryomodules. The facility has contributed to numerous scientific publications and is working to improve system reliability and maximize productivity. Proposals for cost-effective refabrication of cryomodules and resolution of residual magnetic field issues are being explored. Recent physics highlights include measurements of the internal charge and magnetic structure of the proton and the observation of gradual degradation of peak usable gradient in some operational cavities.<br><br>* The meeting discussed the potential of the cold Spectrometer (CLAS) to analyze potential anomalous rf dissipation in the cold rf windows and their adjoining Cu-plated waveguides. The description of complex nuclei at a fundamental level must include correlations among the nucleons beyond the simple mean field model. The meeting also discussed the possibility of a proposed next-generation nuclear physics research facility to be added to CEBAF, which would enable unique 3D mapping of the valence quarks and extend the earlier studies to describe comprehensively the valence quark present momentum and spin distributions in nucleons and nuclei.<br><br>* The transcript discusses various aspects of the CEBAF superconducting accelerator, including the design and production of superconducting cavities, cryomodule testing, and the rf drive system.
