                   CEBAF, the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility, has been actively serving the nuclear
                physics research community as a unique forefront international resource since 1995. This cw electron linear
                accelerator (linac) at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility
                (Jefferson Lab) has continued to evolve as a precision tool for discerning the structure and dynamics within
                nuclei. Superconducting rf (SRF) technology has been the essential foundation for CEBAF, first as a 4 GeV
                machine, then 6 GeV, and currently capable of 12 GeV. We review the development, implementation, and
                performance of SRF systems for CEBAF from its early beginnings to the commissioning of the 12 GeV era.

             D. Cryomodule commissioning
   The overall CEBAF installation and commissioning
exercise was highly orchestrated, with several activities
running in parallel [53,56]. The short injector linac was
commissioned first and used for an experimental check of
multipass beam breakup instability and energy recovery by
implementing a local beam recirculation line [57]. An
energy vernier system was developed and tested in the
north linac for stabilizing the relative energy spread to
better than 2.5 × 10−5 [58]. Also, high current tests were
implemented to check that current modulation effects did
not result in beam energy variability [59]. Cryomodule
commissioning tests were all coordinated by Mike Drury.
The bulk of commissioning of the SRF cryomodules
in both the north and south linacs was completed in               FIG. 6. CEBAF cavity usable performance per vertical accep-

flexible control hardware and software was commissioned
and used for testing the SNS cryomodules and all sub-
sequent CEBAF cryomodule work.
   As the technologies that support web-based information
management (IM) blossomed, JLab SRF sought to exploit
them to enhance labor-efficient workflow, quality assur-
ance, and continuous improvement as a learning organi-
zation. With very little institutional support, the Accelerator
Systems Department launched a small effort to create an IM
system with which to orchestrate the complex set of
procedures and technical data collected during the develop-
ment and production of SRF accelerators. This infrastruc-
ture development proved as vital as any piece of hardware.

trons and LLRF installed in CEBAF could support oper-
ation of the 0.5 m, five-cell cavities to about 13 MV=m
with the required beamloading for physics. The perfor-
mance specification for the reworked cavities was then set
to 12.5 MV=m, which results in an eight-cavity cryomod-
ule providing 50 MeV=pass.
   The cryomodules were thus labeled “C50s” to distin-
guish them from the original cryomodules which typically
provided about 30 MeV=pass [105].
   The project called for reworking three cryomodules per
year in order to establish a solid 6 GeV physics capability
that would in turn serve as the base for a later upgrade to
12 GeV [106]. The project ran from 2006 through 2009.
During the refurbishment process, each cryomodule was
disassembled and its cavities removed and refreshed with
improved processing techniques using vacuum furnace
